# Manifesto for building tech teams

We prize the expertise and mindset of craftsmanship
to build mastery in our craft while helping others to build theirs.


Through our work we have come to value:

We put teams before profits
We incentivize behavior, not performance
We build software to learn
We seek to create value, not just to amass output


In other words, while it's important to meet business figures,
we also value the potential of people to make this happen.
